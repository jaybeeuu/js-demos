        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
                It has different values depending on where it is used:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a method, this refers to the owner object.</li>
                <li>Alone, this refers to the global object.</li>
                <li>In a function, this refers to the global object.</li>
                <li>In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.</li>
                <li>In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
                    <button id="eventful-button">Click Me!</button>
                </li>
                <li>Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>But what about ES6 arrow functions</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            They are much simpler. They inherit <code>this</code> from their declaration.

        <p>
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#No_separate_this">From MDN:</a>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
              An arrow function does not have its own this.
              The this value of the enclosing lexical scope is used;
              arrow functions follow the normal variable lookup rules.
              So while searching for this which is not present in current
              scope they end up finding this from its enclosing scope.
